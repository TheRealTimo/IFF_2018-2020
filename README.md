# IFF_2018-2020
Current version of the website(as of 2019). Created by Timo (@D3CRYqT).
This website has a simple white background with the logo in the center.
The submit page has a black background and white text, which links to the PDF guidelines form and the mailto: for submitting the film.
Very simple website made with bootstrap for responsive design. 
Can be used again, but it is very simple and needs something interesting on it(easteregg maybe?)
