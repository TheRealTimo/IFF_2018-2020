# IFF_2018-2020
This is the 2018 version of the IFF website. The code was written by Gerd (@gerd2002). 
This wesbite has a blurred background video and transparent buttons.
The buttons are simply for getting the PDF form for the guidelines and the other buttons are to submit the movie.
This is an outdated website which can be used again, but would have to be updated.
